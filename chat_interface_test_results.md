## Data Flow Verification ✅

### File Upload → Task Extraction Flow
1. User uploads file via drag & drop or file picker
2. File sent to `/api/recurring-tasks/extract` endpoint
3. OpenAI processes content and extracts structured tasks
4. Tasks added to `extractedTasks` state
5. Preview area updates with extracted tasks
6. System message added to chat history

### Chat Command → Task Modification Flow
1. User types natural language command
2. Command sent to `/api/recurring-tasks/chat` with context
3. OpenAI processes command and current tasks
4. Modified tasks returned in response
5. `extractedTasks` state updated with modifications
6. Preview area reflects changes
7. Assistant response added to chat history

### Task Application Flow
1. User selects tasks to apply
2. Selected tasks converted to recurring task format
3. Tasks created via `/api/recurring-tasks` endpoint
4. Tasks added to user's recurring schedule
5. Preview area cleared of applied tasks

## Error Handling Verification ✅

### Frontend Error Handling
- ✅ File upload failures shown with toast notifications
- ✅ Chat errors display fallback message
- ✅ Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- ✅ Form validation for required fields

### Backend Error Handling
- ✅ Authentication failures return 401
- ✅ Invalid request data returns 400
- ✅ OpenAI failures return 500 with error message
- ✅ File processing errors handled gracefully

## Testing Scenarios Completed ✅
